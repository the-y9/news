  - President's Rule in Manipur, which was imposed last year, has now ended.
  - A new Chief Minister has taken office in Manipur.
  - The imposition of President's Rule in Manipur was a consequence of significant violence that occurred in May 2023, leading to displacement and loss of life.
  - Manipur has a history of frequent President's Rule impositions, with the recent one being the 11th instance.
  - The first President's Rule in Manipur lasted for 66 days from March 12 to March 19, 1967.
  - The longest duration of President's Rule in Manipur was 2 years and 157 days, from October 17, 1969, to March 2, 1972.

  - President's Rule, also known as State Emergency or Constitutional Emergency, is covered under Article 356 of the Indian Constitution.
  - It can be imposed if a state government is not functioning according to the Constitution, or if a state government fails to implement directions from the Central Government (Article 365).
  - Article 355 obliges the Union to protect states against external aggression and internal disturbances, which can be a ground for President's Rule.
  - Article 357 empowers the President to make laws for a state under President's Rule.

  - When President's Rule is in effect, governance of the state comes under the Central Government, the state legislature may be suspended or dissolved, and the President exercises executive control.
  - The judiciary, specifically the High Court, remains unaffected by President's Rule.
  - The Supreme Court in S.R. Bommai vs. Union of India (1994) held that the imposition of President's Rule is subject to judicial review.
  - The Supreme Court in Rameshwar Prasad Case (2006) stated that the recommendation for imposing President's Rule must be based on objective criteria, not merely the subjective opinion of the Central Government.
  - The Sarkaria Commission (1988) recommended that President's Rule should be invoked only as a last resort, considering its negative impact on federalism.
  - The Punchhi Commission (2010) suggested that President's Rule should be applied only to the specific area where violence or disturbance has occurred, rather than the entire state.
  - Criticisms of President's Rule include its frequent use, potential for centralization of power, disruption of democratic processes, and misuse for political motives.

## Social Justice
#### Headline: Denotified Tribes Demand Constitutional Recognition and Separate Census Entry Amidst Persistent Disadvantage
  - Denotified Tribes (DNTs) are demanding constitutional recognition and a separate entry in the upcoming census.
  - Historically, these communities were labeled as "Criminal Tribes" under the British-era Criminal Tribes Act of 1871.
  - The Criminal Tribes Act was repealed in 1952, and these communities were then termed Denotified Tribes.
  - DNTs argue that despite the removal of the "criminal" tag, they continue to face social discrimination and economic backwardness.
  - Many members of DNTs are currently categorized under Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), or Other Backward Classes (OBC), while a significant portion remains unclassified, limiting their access to reservation benefits.
  - They are advocating for a distinct identity and separate reservation benefits, similar to SC, ST, and OBC categories.
  - The upcoming census in 2027 will include a caste-based enumeration for the first time since 1931, presenting an opportunity for DNTs to seek a separate column.
  - DNTs are concerned that if they are not included as a separate category in the 2027 census, they may be overlooked again.
  - They are seeking a separate constitutional schedule, akin to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
  - The population of DNTs, along with Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes, is estimated to be around 10% of India's total population.
  - Previous attempts to support DNTs include the Renke Commission and the Aided Commission (2014), which recommended a permanent National Commission.
  - The Seed Scheme, implemented by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, aims to provide support to DNTs but has reportedly seen underutilization of its budget (₹70 crore spent out of a ₹200 crore budget from 2021-2026).
  - A major issue highlighted is the lack of caste certificates for DNTs, which prevents them from availing benefits from various welfare schemes and institutional support (e.g., scholarships, housing).
  - The Welfare Board for Denotified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Communities (DWBDNC), set up in February 2019, is reportedly dysfunctional due to lack of funding, staff, and leadership.
  - The Supreme Court in August 2024 acknowledged that many DNTs within SC and ST categories require subclassifications and targeted support.
  - The National Commission for Denotified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes, headed by Biku Ramji Idate, identified over 1200 communities that require recognition and support.
