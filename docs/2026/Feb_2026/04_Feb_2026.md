#### Headline: MP Local Area Development (MPLAD) Scheme faces scrutiny over underutilization and corruption allegations.
  - The Member of Parliament Local Area Development (MPLAD) Scheme, a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, allows MPs to recommend development projects worth ₹5 crore annually.
  - Reports indicate significant underutilization of funds by some Members of Parliament, particularly in Delhi, where substantial amounts remain unspent and carry forward.
  - Allegations of corruption, including non-existent projects, fake claims, and the involvement of single vendors potentially linked to MPs, have surfaced.
  - There is a mandatory provision for MPs to allocate a minimum of 15% of their funds for projects benefiting Scheduled Castes and 7.5% for Scheduled Tribes.
  - Nominated Rajya Sabha MPs can recommend projects anywhere in India, while elected Rajya Sabha MPs can recommend projects within their state, and Lok Sabha MPs within their constituency.
  - The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) oversees the scheme, with District Administrations responsible for implementation.
  - The scheme is non-lapsable, meaning unused funds carry forward to the next financial year, accumulating over the MP's tenure.

#### Headline: NAMASTE Scheme aims to mechanize sanitation work and eliminate manual scavenging.
  - The National Action for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE) Scheme, a joint initiative of the Ministry of Social Justice and Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, aims to mechanize sanitation work.
  - Launched in 2022, the scheme's primary objective is to replace manual scavenging with machine-based cleaning.
  - Profiling of sanitation workers in urban areas is being conducted to identify those engaged in waste picking and sanitation.
  - Data reveals that a significant majority (84%) of identified sanitation workers belong to Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe, and Other Backward Classes communities.
  - Some states like Delhi and Goa show a higher proportion of sanitation workers from the General Category.
  - The scheme is implemented by the National Safai Karamchari Finance and Development Corporation and aims to provide health insurance, safety measures, and rehabilitation to sanitation workers.

#### Headline: Supreme Court's approach to death penalty cases highlights concerns over judicial adherence to guidelines.
  - The Supreme Court has not confirmed any death penalty sentences in the last three years, though lower courts continue to award them.
  - Lower courts are observed to frequently award the death penalty, often without strictly adhering to the "rarest of rare" doctrine established by the Supreme Court.
  - In 2023, lower courts sentenced 128 individuals to death, but the confirmation rate by High Courts and the Supreme Court remains very low.
  - The Supreme Court, in cases like Bachan Singh vs. State of Punjab (1980), has laid down guidelines for awarding the death penalty, including the "rarest of rare" principle, requiring brutal murders, depraved motives, and significant crimes.
  - Guidelines also stipulate a minimum 15-day gap between conviction and sentencing to allow for psychological preparation, which is often overlooked by subordinate courts.
  - The constitutionality of the death penalty has been upheld, but its application remains a subject of debate due to concerns about fairness, deterrence, and human rights.

## Economy
#### Headline: US-India trade deal details remain unclear; tariff on steel and penalty on oil imports reduced.
  - Specific details regarding the US-India trade deal are still pending clarification, with the Commerce Minister stating that more information will be available upon signing.
  - While the trade deal has been announced, it has not yet been formally signed.
  - A significant development is the reduction of the 25% penalty on India's oil imports from Russia to zero.
  - The tariff on steel has been reduced from 25% to 18%.
  - The impact of these tariff reductions on India's exports, particularly in sectors like leather and carpets, is expected to be positive.
  - The concept of "reciprocal tariffs" as employed by the Trump administration, where the US imposed tariffs based on tariffs levied by other countries, was discussed.
  - Government assurances indicate that farmers and exporters have been considered, and strategic sectors will be protected.

#### Headline: AI investment to shift focus from infrastructure to applications for higher returns.
  - The next wave of investment in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is predicted to move from infrastructure (data centers, semiconductors) towards applications and platforms.
  - While significant investment has gone into AI infrastructure, companies developing AI applications and platforms are expected to generate higher profits.
