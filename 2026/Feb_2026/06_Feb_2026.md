#### Headline: 18 Dead in Illegal Meghalaya Mine Blast, Highlighting Persistent Rat-Hole Mining Dangers
  - An explosion in an illegal coal mine in Meghalaya's East Jaintia Hills district resulted in the deaths of 18 people.
  - The incident underscores the ongoing problem of illegal coal mining, specifically "rat-hole mining," in Meghalaya, despite being banned by the National Green Tribunal (NGT).
  - Rat-hole mining involves creating narrow tunnels, often by children, to extract coal, lacking structural support and posing extreme safety risks.
  - Historical incidents of fatalities due to rat-hole mining in Meghalaya have occurred repeatedly since at least 2012, with casualties in 2012 (15), 2013 (5), 2018 (15), and 2021 (6).
  - The practice continues due to the difficulty of extracting thin veins of coal scattered over large areas and the private ownership of land where coal is found, bypassing government control.
  - The recent incident involved a blast, likely due to dynamites, trapping workers and leading to their deaths.
  - The Meghalaya government has ordered an inquiry, registered FIRs under various acts, and announced ex-gratia compensation for the deceased's families.
  - Past committees, like the **Justice BP Katakey Committee**, have reportedly failed to bring about significant change in addressing rat-hole mining.
  - Environmental damage, including water contamination, is a significant consequence of this mining practice.

## Polity & Governance
#### Headline: Minor Forest Produce Procurement Drops 92%, Affecting Tribal Livelihoods
  - Government procurement of Minor Forest Produce (MFP) has seen a drastic decline of 92% in 2024-25 compared to the previous year, as reported in Parliament.
  - MFP includes non-timber forest products like tendu leaves, honey, bamboo, mahua flowers, and medicinal herbs, which are a primary livelihood source for tribal communities.
  - The government purchases MFP at Minimum Support Price (MSP) to provide a fair income and prevent exploitation by middlemen.
  - The **Ministry of Tribal Affairs**, along with state governments and agencies like **TRIFED**, is responsible for implementing this procurement.
  - Despite ₹319 crore in funds released by the central government to states for MFP procurement, actual purchases have significantly decreased, impacting tribal incomes.
  - This decline is considered a **Centrally Sponsored Scheme**, meaning states are primarily responsible for the actual procurement with financial support from the center.
  - The situation may force tribal communities to rely on private traders, potentially leading to exploitation.

#### Headline: Forest Rights Act 2006: Empowering Forest Dwellers and Protecting Livelihoods
  - The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA) aims to protect the rights of forest-dwelling communities.
  - The Act recognizes and vests forest rights in, and ownership of, forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers.
  - FRA does not grant new rights but strengthens existing ones, focusing on community rights over forest land and resources.
  - Key provisions include rights to habitat, cultivation on occupied land **(before December 13, 2005)**, and ownership of Minor Forest Produce (MFP).
  - Section 3(1)(c) of FRA specifically grants forest dwellers the ownership of MFP, although they **cannot sell or transfer this ownership**.
  - The Act promotes self-governance, poverty reduction, and livelihood security for tribal communities.
  - Rights are **heritable**, allowing for transfer to the next generation, and joint registration promotes gender justice.
  - The **Ministry of Tribal Affairs** is the nodal agency for implementing FRA at the national level.
  - Past UPSC questions have tested understanding of FRA, including its definition of bamboo as MFP and its provision of ownership rights.

## Science & Technology
#### Headline: India Develops Super Fast Charging Sodium-Ion Battery: A Potential Lithium-Ion Alternative
  - Indian scientists have developed a super fast-charging sodium-ion battery capable of charging to 80% in just 6 minutes.
  - This new technology has a lifespan of over 3,000 charge cycles, offering significant durability.
  - Sodium-ion batteries utilize sodium ions (Na+) as charge carriers, similar to how lithium ions (Li+) work in lithium-ion batteries.
  - The working principle involves the movement of sodium ions between the anode and cathode during discharge and charging, mediated by an electrolyte.
  - Unlike lithium-ion batteries, which rely on scarce and geopolitically sensitive minerals like lithium, cobalt, and nickel, sodium-ion batteries use abundant and cheaper raw materials.
  - Sodium is readily available from sources like seawater and common salt (NaCl).
  - The use of aluminum as the current collector in sodium-ion batteries makes them potentially cheaper than copper-based lithium-ion batteries.
  - Advantages include safer *transportation at zero voltage*, *reduced fire risk*, and *better thermal stability* compared to lithium-ion batteries.
  - While current sodium-ion batteries have *lower energy density* than lithium-ion batteries, ongoing research and development, particularly in layered oxide sodium cathodes, aims to bridge this gap.
  - These batteries are seen as a viable alternative for electric vehicles (especially two- and three-wheelers), grid storage, and consumer electronics, supporting India's clean energy goals.
  - India needs a coordinated approach, including policy, R&D, and market creation, to adopt and produce sodium-ion batteries.
  - A 2025 UPSC question highlighted that ***cobalt, lithium, and nickel*** are used in the ***cathodes*** of electric vehicle batteries, with ***graphite used in anodes***.
